Origin is empowering developers to build decentralized marketplaces on the blockchain!

Visit our [Developer's page](https://www.originprotocol.com/developers) to learn more about what we're building and how to get involved.

You can see the Origin ecosystem in action at https://dapp.originprotocol.com.

## Our Projects:

* [origin-js](https://github.com/OriginProtocol/origin/tree/master/origin-js) is a library of javascript code and Ethereum smart contracts which allows anyone to create decentralized marketplaces.
* Our [DApp](https://github.com/OriginProtocol/origin/tree/master/origin-dapp) is the first marketplace powered by the Origin Protocol. Make the code your own!
* The [discovery server](https://github.com/OriginProtocol/origin/tree/master/origin-discovery) provides a GraphQL service for quickly searching Origin blockchain data.
* Our [bridge server](https://github.com/OriginProtocol/origin/tree/master/origin-bridge) provides identity attestations. 
* Run every part of our infrastructure locally for development and testing with [origin-box](https://github.com/OriginProtocol/origin/tree/master/development)—a set of Docker containers orchestrated with Docker Compose.
* Finally, we have a [testnet faucet](https://github.com/OriginProtocol/origin/tree/master/origin-faucet) and a distributed [messaging hub](https://github.com/OriginProtocol/origin/tree/master/origin-messaging).
