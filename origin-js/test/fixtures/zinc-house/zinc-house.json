  "description": "Overlooking Lake Llanquihue, Casa Wulf is inspired by the terrain. The home sits on a steep slope. This lead to its three-story design, creating a natural balcony facing the water. Among the levels, the main living area is at the center, with the bedrooms above and a basement workshop below. Each floor was constructed using a different system, resulting in a range of facades. Their orientation takes advantage of the incoming sunlight and while also exposing the interiors to the surrounding landscape.",
