# origin.js Tests

This dirctory contains tests over the components of origin.js.

When you begin developing, run `npm test` and keep it running while you develop.

View test results in your browser (with MetaMask installed and setup) at http://localhost:8081

Tests are automatically rerun when source or test code is changed.

Run a subset of tests using the `grep` query string parameter, for example: http://localhost:8081/?grep=IpfsService
